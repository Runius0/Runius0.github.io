		<h1>Nth Sanctuary</h1>
		<p>
		nth sanctuary (also known as "_th sanctuary" or "#th sanctuary") is a fangame for <a href="https://deltarune.com">DELTARUNE</a>. </br>
		it was initially created by Ralszor, who is the main head of the project. </br>
		nth sanctuary was inspired by the yume nikki styled fangame b3313 for mario 64, alongside the strange and explorative nature of the sanctuaries in Deltarune chapter 4. </br>
		</br></br>
		The project was also inspired by the fan movement online of producing music for conceptual sanctuaries, due to the iconic and complex nature of the themes of the three sanctuaries featured in the base game.

		<h1>The Story</h1>
		<p>
		the story of nth sanctuary follows after the events of chapter 4. Kris, Susie, and Ralsei (and others too) find themselves in an endless maze of sanctuaries, without a concievable way out. This new wave of sanctuaries comes about after a cult who worships the knight performs a ritual, creating an overflow of darkness. The Fun Gang must find and slay titans and gather the dark shards to possibly find an exit to the endless twists and turns.
		</br></br>
		Find the dark shards. Open the doors. Find a way out.
