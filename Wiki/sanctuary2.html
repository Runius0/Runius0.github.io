		<h1>Second Sanctuary</h1>
		<p>
		The second sanctuary is based on the sanctuary of the same name from the original Deltarune Chapter 4, however it does not share it's layout. be careful.<br><br>
		Nth sanctuary is currently in a beta state, as such this area has no exits, and thus is a softlock if you enter.
		</p>
		<h2>Central room</h2>
		<p>
		As the second sanctuary is currently unfinished, only 1 room exists in the current public build of the game. There is a broken exit on the bottom of the screen that leads nowhere.<br><br>
		You will find Noelle in this room, upon approach a cutscene will trigger in which Susie pushes Noelle off of the edge of the platform.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
