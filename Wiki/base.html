		<h1>Base Sanctum</h1>
		<p>
		The base sanctum is the first, and currently the largest area implemented in the game, consisting of 5 rooms. The central area is the first save point you will encounter in the game, and the fast travel point is to the north.<br><br>
		When first entered, a cutscene will play, moving the player over to view the first prophecy panel. Once triggered this cutscene does not play again.<br><br>
		There are 2 NPC encounters and 1 enemy encounter in the base sanctum, described in the appropriate section below.
		</p>
		<h2>Central room</h2>
		<p>
		The central room is the first room of the base sanctum and also the first room in nth sanctuary.<br><br>
		
		Upon entry of this room, a cutscene will play, in which susie examines the prophecy to the left of the starting point. <br><br>

		The room prominently features a save point in the center, which can be used to save the player's progress<br><br>

		Across the wooden bridge to the south, the first player encounter with the lobby man can be found. The lobby man provides vague hints towards the story, and is able to name the current sanctuary that the player interracts with them in. Upon completion of the interraction, the lobby man will dissappear until the room is reloaded.
		</p>
		<h2>Fast travel room</h2>
		<p>
		The fast travel room consists of multiple doors, which lead to different areas. Each door becomes accessible after obtaining the amount of dark shards displayed above it. The only door accessible in the current version is the 1 dark shard door, which provides a one way connection to the <a href="sanctuary4.html">4th sanctuary</a>.
		</p>
		<h2>East room</h2>
		<p>
		The eastern room of the base sanctum contains a prophecy, which references a party member which can be recruited later in the room.<br><br>
		The room serves as the introduction of the climbing mechanic from Deltarune chapter 4 into nth sanctuary, as well as being able to recruit Jamm. Jamm is an additional party member, so it is highly reccomended to recruit him as his presence will significantly speed up many battles. His intro cutscene showcases his personality to the player.<br><br>
		After Jamm is recruited, this cutscene will no longer play.
		</p>
		<h2>Far East room</h2>
		<p>
		The furthest east room of the base sanctum contains an enemy encounter with 2 Guei, an enemy recreated from the original Deltarune chapter 4, alongside a prophecy on the right side of the room.<br><br>
		The northern exit to this map will take the player to the <a href="sanctuary4.html">4th sanctuary</a>.
		</p>
		<h2>Southern room</h2>
		<p>
		The southern room is rather empty at first glance, featuring three sets of stairs and no interactable objects. However, while walking down the final staircase, the player can walk behind a foreground pillar, revealing a secret entryway into <a href="hell.html">hell</a>.<br><br>
		However the room is otherwise empty.
		</p>
		<h2>Far Southern room</h2>
		<p>
		This room serves solely as a one-way entrance to the <a href="sanctuary2.html">2nd sanctuary</a>.<br><br>
		The south side of the room contains a large doorway, approaching the doorway will trigger a cutscene, which upon completion will forcefully transport the player to the <a href="sanctuary2.html">2nd sanctuary</a>. Due to the incomplete nature of the 2nd sanctuary, it is impossible to return after this transition, thus requiring that a save be reloaded to continue. For this reason it is reccomended not to trigger this cutscene to avoid a softlock.
