		<h1>Hell</h1>
		<p>
		Hell is a secret sanctuary available by taking a hidden route in the southern room of the base sanctum.
		</p>
		<h2>Central room</h2>
		<p>
		despite appearing to not have any exit paths, the central room of hell is actually a four way intersection, however only the sothern path is currently implemented.<br><br>
		There is a save point in the center to allow you to save your game.<br><br>
		Exiting out of the south exit will return you to the <a href="base">base sanctum</a>.<br><br>
		On the southern path, a leech titan spawn blocks the route to the exit. This custom titan spawn type has the ability to regenerate health if you are hit by one of its attacks.<br><br>
		Alongside the four main exits, there is also a secret exit split from the west side of the southern path.
		</p>
		<h2>Secret Room</h2>
		<p>
		There is a secret room accessible by moving west from the central room of hell. This room contains a stationary image of frisk from Undertale, with interract text, alongside a matching prophecy.
