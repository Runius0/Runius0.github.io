		<h1>Fourth Sanctuary</h1>
		<p>
		The fourth sanctuary is currently the most recent sanctuary added to the game. Despite it being unfinished it contains a decent amount of content.
		</p>
		<h2>Central room</h2>
		<p>
		As it is unfinished there is only one room in the fourth sanctuary, with an unfinished exit to the right.<br><br>
		In the center of the room, a save point is placed, which can be used to save your progress.<br><br>
		The fourth sanctuary is the second time which you can interract with the lobby man, once again he relays the player's location within the game. This time however he has no story clues.<br><br>
		The fourth sanctuary features interractive moss in the corner of the central room, which becomes a healing item once picked up, healing 125HP to Kris or Susie, and only 1HP to any other party member.<br><br>
		Leaving out of the bottom exit will return you to the <a href="base">base sanctum</a>.<br><br><br>
